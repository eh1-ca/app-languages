This is the repository for the eh1.ca social network translation files.

The `lang` folder contains one JSON file per language, named using the two-character ISO code.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! If you’d like to help with translation or accessibility, feel free to fork and submit a PR.

### To add or improve translations:
1. Update the corresponding language files (`lang/en.json`, `lang/fr.json`)
2. Ensure the JSON structure is valid and semantically consistent
3. To add a new language, create a new file using the ISO 639-1 code (e.g., `lang/es.json` for Spanish)

# TODO

- Fix the issue with relative date/time formatting, as other languages may not follow the "x sec/min/hours/etc ago" pattern.
